# AIX Lab Simulation - Practice Exercises

Welcome to the AIX Lab Simulation practice guide! This file contains hands-on exercises to help you learn AIX commands effectively.

## üéØ Getting Started

First, make sure you've set up the simulation:
```bash
source ./aix_simulation.sh
```

## üìã Basic Exercises

### Exercise 1: System Information
Learn to gather basic system information:
```bash
# Check AIX version and maintenance level
oslevel
oslevel -r
oslevel -s

# Get complete system information
uname -a

# Check system configuration
prtconf | head -20

# Get memory information
bootinfo -r
```

**Try it yourself**: What's the difference between `oslevel`, `oslevel -r`, and `oslevel -s`?

### Exercise 2: Storage Management
Understanding AIX storage hierarchy:
```bash
# List all physical volumes
lspv

# Get detailed info about hdisk0
lspv hdisk0

# List all volume groups
lsvg

# Show detailed info about rootvg
lsvg rootvg
lsvg -l rootvg

# List logical volumes
lslv hd4

# Check file system usage
df -g
lsfs
```

**Challenge**: Explain the relationship between hdisk0, rootvg, and the logical volumes shown.

### Exercise 3: Performance Monitoring
Monitor system performance:
```bash
# Check current processes
ps -ef

# See who's logged in
w
who

# Monitor system performance
topas
vmstat 2 5
iostat 2

# Check memory and swap usage
lsps -a
```

**Practice**: Start `topas` and observe the different metrics displayed.

### Exercise 4: Network Diagnostics
Explore network configuration:
```bash
# Show network interfaces
ifconfig -a

# Display routing table
netstat -rn

# Show network connections
netstat -an

# Test connectivity (simulated)
ping google.com
```

**Exercise**: What information can you gather about the network configuration?

### Exercise 5: Service Management
Learn about AIX services:
```bash
# List all services
lssrc -a

# List TCP/IP services specifically
lssrc -g tcpip

# Check specific service status
lssrc -s sshd
lssrc -s cron
```

**Question**: How many services are running in the tcpip group?

### Exercise 6: Error Analysis
Understanding system errors:
```bash
# View error log
errpt

# Show detailed error information
errpt -a

# Filter errors by date
errpt -s 0101000024

# Show only hardware errors
errpt -T PERM
```

**Analysis**: Look at the different types of errors and their classifications.

## üîß Advanced Exercises

### Exercise 7: Deep Storage Dive
```bash
# Examine volume group details
lsvg -p rootvg    # Show physical volumes
lsvg -l rootvg    # Show logical volumes
lsvg -L rootvg    # Show VG characteristics

# Look at specific logical volume
lslv -l hd4       # Show which PV it's on
lslv -m hd4       # Show logical to physical mapping

# File system details
lsfs -q /
lsfs -l /usr
```

### Exercise 8: Device Management
```bash
# List all devices
lsdev

# Show only available devices
lsdev -C

# Look at processor info
lsdev -Cc processor

# Show device attributes
lsattr -El sys0
lsattr -El hdisk0
```

### Exercise 9: Network Deep Dive
```bash
# Detailed interface statistics
entstat en0

# Network performance
netstat -i

# Protocol statistics
netstat -s
```

## üéì Scenarios-Based Learning

### Scenario 1: Disk Space Investigation
You've been told the system is running low on disk space. Use AIX commands to:
1. Check overall disk usage
2. Identify which file systems are full
3. Determine which volume groups have available space
4. Find the physical layout of storage

```bash
# Your commands here:
# df -g
# lsvg
# lspv
```

### Scenario 2: Performance Troubleshooting
Users are complaining about slow system performance. Investigate:
1. Check current system load
2. Identify resource-intensive processes
3. Check memory and swap usage
4. Monitor I/O performance

```bash
# Your investigation commands:
# topas
# ps -ef | sort
# vmstat
# iostat
```

### Scenario 3: Service Issues
A network service isn't responding properly. Troubleshoot:
1. Check if network services are running
2. Verify network configuration
3. Test connectivity
4. Look for related error messages

```bash
# Your troubleshooting steps:
# lssrc -g tcpip
# ifconfig -a
# netstat -an
# errpt
```
